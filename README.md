# RoSearcher
Reupload of Nexure's rosearcher!


# How to use

Download the repository as a zip file & extract it somewhere that you wont delete it

Go to `chrome://extensions` & enable developer mode (there will be a toggle for this, it also works on other chromium-based browsers such as brave & edge)

Click the load unpacked extension button & find the folder than you extracted rosearcher to

Once you've done that, you're free to use rosearcher!
